-> We only need to get the GET requests & HTTP 200 OK - 
1-Check for GET and if it is true then check for status 200 OK.

-> Content Type-1)Text/HTML or 2) Use "else" for this case.

2-Text/HTML case-


	A>>Read upto a blank line(Header end)
		then read the next line which would be a hexadecimal no., convert it into a decimal no. then read upto that many bytes.
	B>>Read the next line after the stipulated no. of bytes (A hex no. again), convert it into a decimal no. then read upto that many bytes.
	
Repeat the steps A and B until we encounter a 0 which means it has ended.<<There should be 1 or 2 blank lines after the 0>>

3-Image/PNG case/else case-

	A>>Read the line that says Content-Length and read that many bytes.

All these steps 1,2 and 3 would be in a loop
